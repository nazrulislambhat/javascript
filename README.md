| **Async JS**                   | Understand how asynchronous JavaScript works, including event loops, callback queues, and the call stack.              |
| **Callbacks & Promises**       | Learn about callback functions and Promises, which are used for handling asynchronous operations.                      |
| **`this` (call, apply, bind)** | Explore the `this` keyword in JavaScript and how `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` affect function contexts.           |
| **Async Await**                | Learn how `async/await` makes asynchronous code more readable by using promises in a synchronous manner.               |
| **Working with APIs**          | Learn how to interact with external data through APIs using `fetch()` and other methods to retrieve data.              |
| **Classes**                    | Understand ES6 classes to create reusable object-oriented code with constructors, methods, and inheritance.            |

| **Modules in JS**              | Explore how to use ES6 modules to import and export functionality across multiple files.                               |
| **Memory Management**          | Learn techniques for managing memory in JavaScript, including garbage collection and optimizing performance.           |
| **Debugging**                  | Develop debugging skills to identify and fix issues in JavaScript code using browser dev tools and logging techniques. |
| **Fetch**                      | Learn how to use the `fetch()` API for making HTTP requests and handling responses asynchronously.                     |
| **localStorage**               | Understand how to store data persistently in the browser using `localStorage` and its limitations.                     |
| **sessionStorage**             | Learn about `sessionStorage` for storing data for the duration of a page session.                                      |
| **Service Workers**            | Understand how Service Workers work to enable offline capabilities, caching, and background tasks in web apps.         |
| **WebSockets**                 | Learn about WebSockets for creating real-time, bi-directional communication between a client and server.               |
