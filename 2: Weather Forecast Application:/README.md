# Weather Forecast Application:

**JavaScript Topics to Cover:**

- Fetch API: Making HTTP requests to fetch weather data from a third-party API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
- Asynchronous JavaScript: Handling asynchronous operations when fetching data.
- JSON parsing: Parsing the JSON response from the API to extract relevant information.
- Displaying data: Updating the UI with the fetched weather information.
- Error handling: Handling errors gracefully, such as network errors or invalid responses.

**Advanced Topics:**

- Promises and async/await: Refactoring callback-based code to use promises or async/await for cleaner asynchronous code handling.
- Error handling strategies: Implementing retry mechanisms for failed API requests or handling rate limits gracefully.
- Geolocation API: Enhancing the application to automatically detect the user's location and display local weather information.
